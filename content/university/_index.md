# University
### Bachelor of Engineering
I finished course of study named "Computer Science and Information Technologies" at Faculty of Mathematics and Information Sciences ([MiNI](https://ww2.mini.pw.edu.pl/)) at Warsaw University of Technology. My final descriptive grade was "very good", with GDP of 4.47 (on 2-5 scale).

### Graded projects
As part of courses I have developed several projects (with different levels of sophistication). Those worth mentioning are the following:
- Shogi game, server and engine (thesis project)
- k-means algorithm implementaton on GPU
- Raspberry Pi MP3 player
- 3D computer graphics rendering demo
- Rubik's cube timer mobile app
